Data 출처에 아래와 같이 기술되어 있음.

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 
In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to  this date. 
The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. 
Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) 
from absence (value 0). 

그러므로 입력속성은 14개만 사용하였고, 목표속성 disease의 값이 2,3,4인 것은 모두 1로 변환하였음.
